Design a cv application to enforece the learning of the componets and jsx and how to style it;
	also learning what props to pass and how to use them and when to use state isntead of props
	also learning how to manage basic state between components and such..
APP -> NAV, MAIN 			==== done
	NAV -> LOGO, EXPORT ==== done
	MAIN -> FORMS, PREVIEW
			FORMS -> GENERAL INFO, EDUCATION, EXPERIENCE
			PREVIEW -> GENERAL INFO, EDUCATION, EXPERIENCE

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
